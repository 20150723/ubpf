# uBPF

Userspace eBPF VM (eventually)

## About

This project aim to create an Apache-licensed library for executing eBPF programs. The primary implementation of eBPF lives in the Linux kernel, but due to its GPL license it can't be used in many projects.

[Linux documentation for the eBPF instruction set] (https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/networking/filter.txt).

Currently this project includes an eBPF disassembler.
